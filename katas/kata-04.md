# Deno kata 4 - Setting up a static build

The purpose of this kata is to create a static build of our webpage and set up a static file server to host it. Technically the static build could easily be hosted on any static host online but it is good to understand what it could look like in technical terms.

## Learning aims

The idea here is to take the existing implementation and refactor it to support static rendering as a separate script. We cover the following:

* Setting up a static build script
* Extracting JSX so it can be used with both the development server and the production build
* Building a static file server

## Task

Complete the following:
